# Multimodal Data Analysis and Processing Project

## Image Data

### Imbalance Analysis
- Checked for class imbalance in the dataset.
- Plotted a bar plot to visualize the number of images per class.
- Identified imbalanced classes and proposed methods to balance the dataset.

### Histogram Visualization
- Randomly selected 8 images and plotted their respective histograms.
- Labels were added to each histogram to indicate their corresponding class.

### Class Statistics
- Calculated and displayed the mean and variance of each class.
- Drew insights from these statistical measures for further analysis.

### Standardization
- Standardized 4 random images from a specific class.
- Visualized the effects of standardization on the images.
- Included observations and insights.

### Image Transformations
- Applied random rotation, cropping, and scaling transformations to images.
- Showcased both the original and transformed versions of the images.

## Audio Data

### Audio Length Analysis
- Determined the mean audio length for each class.
- Addressed any class imbalance issues.
- Proposed methods for balancing the dataset.

### Spectrogram Visualization
- Plotted spectrograms for 4 randomly selected audio recordings from the complete dataset.

### Pre-Emphasis Filter
- Implemented the Pre-Emphasis filter from scratch.
- Visualized its impact on 4 randomly selected audio recordings.
- Explained the purpose of the Pre-Emphasis filter.

### Upsampling and Downsampling
- Conducted upsampling and downsampling of audio samples from Class 1.
- Visualized the before and after spectrograms.
- Provided observations based on the transformations.

### Audio Format Comparison
- Saved a 2-second chunk of a randomly selected audio in .mp3 and .flac formats.
- Compared spectrograms of all three formats (.wav, .flac, .mp3).
- Documented observations and differences between formats.

## Text Data

### Text Length Analysis
- Calculated the average text length for both English and Hindi corpora, including whitespace and punctuation.

### Punctuation Removal
- Randomly selected 20 parallel texts and removed punctuation and special characters.

### Dictionary Creation
- Randomly selected 50 parallel texts and created dictionaries for both English and Hindi corpora.
- Ensured unique numeric mappings for each word.

### Top 10 Occurring Words
- Identified and plotted the histogram of the top 10 most occurring words in the text data.
